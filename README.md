# Steam Mobile

A headless, fully-typed **ESM TypeScript** client for the **Steam mobile app**, built for trading. It
unifies the *web* logic of [`steamcommunity`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity) and
[`steam-tradeoffer-manager`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-tradeoffer-manager) into one
cohesive, Promise-native package — with **no `steam-user` and no Steam CM binary protocol**.

Everything the mobile app needs is in-package: credential login, TOTP, mobile confirmations
(`mobileconf`), and the `IAuthenticationService` protobufs. The only runtime dependencies are
[`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got), [`proxy-agent`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents),
[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie), [`steamid`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamid),
and [`@bufbuild/protobuf`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es).

The client impersonates the Steam mobile app on the wire (a MobileApp-platform access token, per-host
user agents, mobile cookies, and `mobileconf` confirmations). MobileApp is the only platform whose
access token can self-renew over plain HTTP, which is what lets this library run headless without a
persistent CM connection.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add steam-mobile   # Node 22+, ESM only
```

This package is ESM-only and targets Node 22+. Import it with `import { SteamMobile } from "steam-mobile"`.

## The basics

```ts
import { SteamMobile } from "steam-mobile";

const bot = await new SteamMobile({
  refreshToken: process.env.STEAM_REFRESH_TOKEN!,
  identitySecret: process.env.STEAM_IDENTITY_SECRET, // only needed to confirm trades
}).login();

console.log("Logged in as", bot.steamID.getSteamID64());

const { sent, received } = await bot.trade.getTradeOffers();
console.log(`${sent.length} sent, ${received.length} received`);
```

Construction is **synchronous** and does no network I/O — your `steamID` is known immediately because
it is encoded in the refresh-token JWT. The single network step is `await bot.login()`, which mints the
access token and applies the login cookie. Every method awaits the token lazily, so you *can* call
methods before `login()`, but calling `login()` up front gives you fail-fast behavior and lets you
auto-start polling.

---

## Logging in

There are two ways to get a session. In production you almost always want the **refresh-token** path:
log in once with credentials, store the long-lived refresh token, and reuse it.

### From a refresh token (the normal path)

```ts
const bot = await new SteamMobile({ refreshToken }).login();
```

A MobileApp refresh token lives ~211 days. The library renews the ~24-hour access token lazily and
rotates the refresh token automatically as it nears end-of-life — emitting a [`refreshToken`](#event-refreshtoken)
event each time so you can persist the new one.

### From credentials

When you don't yet have a refresh token, use `loginWithCredentials`. This drives the full
`IAuthenticationService` credential flow (RSA password encryption → begin session → answer Steam Guard
→ poll) entirely in-package — no `steam-session` needed.

#### loginWithCredentials(options)

- `options`
  - `username` — Your Steam account name (login name, not persona).
  - `password` — Your account password.
  - `sharedSecret` — Optional. Your TOTP `shared_secret`. If present, device (TOTP) Steam Guard codes are answered automatically. If the account has **no mobile authenticator** (email Steam Guard only), this rejects up-front with a `NoMobileAuthenticatorError` rather than silently falling through.
  - `steamGuardCode` — Optional. A Steam Guard code you supply yourself (email or device).
  - `proxy` — Optional. A proxy URL; routes the entire login flow.
  - `mobileProfile` — Optional. `"ios"` (default), `"android"`, or an object overriding individual [profile fields](#mobile-app-impersonation).
  - `signal` — Optional. An `AbortSignal`; aborting stops polling and rejects with a `LoginError`.
  - `onSteamGuardRequired` — Optional. `async ({ type, message }) => code`. Called when a code is required and none was supplied (e.g. an email code). Resolve it with the code to continue.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to a **`LoginResult`**:

- `refreshToken` — The MobileApp refresh token. **Store this** and feed it to `new SteamMobile({ refreshToken })`.
- `accessToken` — The freshly-minted access token, or `undefined` if Steam didn't return one.
- `steamId` — The account's SteamID64, as a string.
- `username` — The account name Steam echoed back.

```ts
import { loginWithCredentials, SteamMobile } from "steam-mobile";

const { refreshToken } = await loginWithCredentials({
  username: "myaccount",
  password: "…",
  sharedSecret: "…",            // answers the device-code 2FA automatically
  // onSteamGuardRequired: async ({ message }) => await promptUser(message),
});

const bot = await new SteamMobile({ refreshToken }).login();
```

Credential login is rate-limited by Steam, so do it once per device and reuse the refresh token. For
finer-grained control over the state machine (events for each step, manual code submission), use the
[`CredentialSession`](#credentialsession-low-level) class directly.

#### CredentialSession (low-level)

`loginWithCredentials` is a thin one-shot wrapper around this `EventEmitter`. Use it directly when you
need to react to each step.

- `new CredentialSession(http, profile[, pollTimeoutMs])` — `http` is an `HttpClient`, `profile` a resolved [`MobileProfile`](#mobile-app-impersonation), `pollTimeoutMs` defaults to 180000.
- `start(options)` — Begins the flow. `options` is the credentials (`username`, `password`, `sharedSecret?`, `steamGuardCode?`). Throws `NoMobileAuthenticatorError` synchronously inside `start()` if `sharedSecret` was supplied but the account isn't TOTP-protected. Returns `Promise<void>`.
- `submitSteamGuardCode(code)` — Supplies a code in response to a `steamGuardRequired` event. Returns `Promise<void>`.
- `stop()` — Aborts the flow and clears the poll timer.
- Properties (populated as the flow progresses): `steamID?`, `username`, `accessToken?`, `refreshToken?`.
- Events:
  - `authenticated` — A refresh token is available; read it off the instance.
  - `steamGuardRequired` — `{ type, message }`. No code could be supplied automatically; call `submitSteamGuardCode()`.
  - `remoteInteraction` — Steam is waiting for the user to approve on their phone (device/email confirmation).
  - `timeout` — The confirmation window elapsed.
  - `error` — `error`. The flow failed.
  - `debug` — `message`. Verbose step logging.

---

## SteamMobile

The root client. It owns the HTTP layer, the session, and the namespaces, and it re-emits every
[trade event](#trade-events) so you can listen on `bot` directly instead of `bot.trade`.

### Constructor: new SteamMobile(options)

- `options`
  - `refreshToken` — **Required.** A MobileApp refresh token (from `loginWithCredentials` or a prior session).
  - `identitySecret` — Optional. Your `identity_secret`, required to **confirm** trades and other mobile confirmations. Read-only operations and sending don't need it.
  - `proxy` — Optional. A proxy URL (`http://user:pass@host:port`, `socks5://…`, etc.). All traffic — API, community, and confirmations — routes through it.
  - `mobileProfile` — Optional. `"ios"` (default), `"android"`, or a `Partial<MobileProfile>` to override individual fields. See [Mobile-app impersonation](#mobile-app-impersonation).
  - `polling` — Optional. `true` to start polling with default cadence after `login()`, or a [`PollOptions`](#polloptions) object to tune it / resume from saved `pollData`.

Throws `SteamSessionExpiredError` synchronously if the refresh token is malformed (no SteamID in its
payload). Does **not** make any network request.

### Properties

- `steamID` — A [`SteamID`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamid) object for the logged-in account. Available immediately after construction.
- `accessToken` — The current access token (`string`), or `undefined` before the first mint.
- `refreshToken` — The current refresh token (`string`). This changes when Steam rotates it; listen for the [`refreshToken`](#event-refreshtoken) event to persist updates.
- `identitySecret` — The `identity_secret` you passed, or `undefined`.
- `trade` — The [TradeNamespace](#bottrade).
- `community` — The [CommunityNamespace](#botcommunity).
- `session` — The [SessionManager](#botsession).
- `confirmations` — The [ConfirmationManager](#botconfirmations).
- `http`, `api` — The low-level `HttpClient` and `WebApiClient`. You normally won't need these.

### login()

Mints the access token (failing fast if the refresh token is dead), applies the `steamLoginSecure`
login cookie, and — if you passed `polling` — starts the poll loop. Returns a `Promise` that resolves
to the `SteamMobile` instance itself, so you can write `const bot = await new SteamMobile(opts).login()`.

### reauthenticate(credentials)

- `credentials` — A `ReauthenticateOptions`: the same fields as [`loginWithCredentials`](#loginwithcredentialsoptions) **except** `proxy` / `mobileProfile`, which are reused from this instance.

Recovers a **dead or revoked** refresh token — one the library can no longer renew (past its ~211-day
life, after a password change, or a Steam revocation). Runs a fresh credential login, swaps the new
refresh token in place, re-mints the access token, and re-emits [`refreshToken`](#event-refreshtoken) so
you can persist it. **Rejects if the credentials are for a different account** than this instance.
Returns `Promise<void>`. Pair it with the [`sessionExpired`](#event-sessionexpired) event.

### ensureApiKey(\[domain])

- `domain` — Optional. The domain to register the key under (default `"assetpay.gg"`). Steam's API-key `domain` is a hostname label, not a URL.

Returns the account's existing Web API key, or registers a new one (auto-accepting the mobile
confirmation prompt if `identitySecret` is set), as a `Promise<string | null>`. Resolves to `null` when
the account is **ineligible** for a key (unverified email, no mobile authenticator, or a
[limited account](#notes--limitations)). This is a convenience passthrough to
[`bot.community.ensureApiKey`](#communityensureapikeydomain).

### request(method, url\[, opts]) · get(url\[, opts]) · post(url\[, opts])

Escape hatch for endpoints the typed namespaces don't cover (like `node-steamcommunity`'s
`httpRequest`). Each ensures the session is live — minting/renewing the access token and applying the
`steamLoginSecure` cookie — *before* sending, so the request carries your logged-in session, then
delegates to [`bot.http`](#properties). Throws `SteamSessionExpiredError` if the session can't be
renewed.

- `method` — `"GET"` or `"POST"`.
- `url` — Absolute URL.
- `opts` — A `RequestOptions`: `searchParams`, `headers`, `referer`, `responseType` (`"text"` default, `"json"`, or `"buffer"`), `signal` (an `AbortSignal` to cancel), `timeoutMs` (per-request timeout override; default 50000), and **exactly one** request body of `form`, `multipart`, `json`, or `body` (raw `string`/`Buffer`).

Returns `Promise<HttpResponse<T>>` (`{ statusCode, headers, body }`). Pass a type parameter and
`responseType: "json"` to get a parsed body.

```ts
const { body } = await bot.get<{ success: boolean }>(
  "https://steamcommunity.com/market/priceoverview/",
  { searchParams: { appid: 730, market_hash_name: "Mag-7 | Heat (Field-Tested)", currency: 1 }, responseType: "json" },
);

await bot.post("https://steamcommunity.com/some/endpoint", {
  json: { sessionid: await bot.http.getSessionId(), foo: "bar" },
});
```

For requests where you *don't* want the session ensured first, use `bot.http` directly.

### shutdown()

Stops the poll loop and removes all event listeners (on both `bot` and `bot.trade`). Call this when
you're done with the client so it doesn't keep timers alive. Returns a `Promise<void>`.

### Events

`SteamMobile` re-emits all [trade events](#trade-events) (`newOffer`, `sentOfferChanged`,
`receivedOfferChanged`, `unknownOfferSent`, `pollData`, `pollSuccess`, `pollFailure`, `debug`) plus two
of its own:

#### Event: refreshToken

- `token` — The new refresh token (`string`).

Emitted when Steam rotates your refresh token (which happens automatically near end-of-life). **Persist
the new value** — the old one stops working.

#### Event: sessionExpired

- `error` — A `SteamSessionExpiredError`.

Emitted when the refresh token is rejected or expired and the session can no longer be renewed. It fires
only on a **confirmed-terminal** auth failure (not a transient blip), so it's safe to trigger re-auth
on: call [`bot.reauthenticate(credentials)`](#reauthenticatecredentials).

---

## bot.trade

The trade namespace. It's an `EventEmitter` (see [Trade events](#trade-events)) and holds every method for
reading, sending, and watching trade offers.

### createOffer(target)

- `target` — An [`OfferTarget`](#offertarget): either `{ tradeUrl }` or `{ steamId, token? }`.

Creates a new, empty [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) addressed to the partner. **Local only** — nothing is
sent to Steam until you call [`offer.send()`](#send). Chain `.give()` / `.receive()` / `.setMessage()`
to build it.

### getTradeOffer(id)

- `id` — The trade offer's numeric id, as a string.

Fetches a single offer and returns it as a [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer). Item descriptions are inlined
(`get_descriptions=1`), so the offer's items are full [`EconItem`](#econitem)s. Rejects with a
`SteamError` if the offer doesn't exist.

### getTradeOffers(\[filter]\[, historicalCutoff])

- `filter` — Optional. A value from [`EOfferFilter`](#eofferfilter) (default `ActiveOnly`).
- `historicalCutoff` — Optional. A `Date`. When `filter` includes historical offers, only offers updated at or after this time are returned. Defaults to one year in the future (i.e. "active only").

Returns `Promise<{ sent: TradeOffer[]; received: TradeOffer[] }>`. This cursor-paginates **all** pages
internally and inlines descriptions into every offer's items. If Steam returns the wholly-malformed
"data temporarily unavailable" glitch (all offers missing partner/items), this rejects with a
`SteamError` rather than handing back garbage.

### getTradeStatus({tradeId})

- `tradeId` — The **trade id** (not the offer id). This is set on a [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) once it's accepted (`offer.tradeID`).

Returns settlement details for a completed or escrowed trade as a `Promise<`[`ExchangeDetails`](#exchangedetails)`>`,
including where each item *landed* after the trade (`new_assetid` / `new_contextid`, when Steam provides
them). See [`offer.getTradeStatus()`](#gettradestatus) for the offer-level shortcut.

### getUserDetails(target)

- `target` — An [`OfferTarget`](#offertarget) (typically `{ tradeUrl }`).

Persona, contexts, escrow days, avatars, and partner probation for both sides — same scrape as
[`offer.getUserDetails()`](#getuserdetails) but addressed by target, so you don't need an offer in
hand. Returns `Promise<`[`UserDetails`](#userdetails)`>`. **Steam applies
`max(me.escrowDays, them.escrowDays)`** as the actual hold — compute that yourself if you need a
single number.

### getEscrow(target)

- `target` — An [`OfferTarget`](#offertarget) (typically `{ tradeUrl }`).

Escrow hold (in **seconds**) via `IEconService/GetTradeHoldDurations`. Returns
`Promise<`[`EscrowHold`](#escrowhold)`>` shaped `{ me, them, both }` (top-level renamed from Steam's
`my_escrow` / `their_escrow` / `both_escrow`; inner shape preserved 1:1). Lightweight — just the
WebAPI, no scrape, no other user data. For everything together (escrow + persona + avatars +
contexts), use [`getUserDetails`](#getuserdetailstarget) above (or [`offer.getUserDetails()`](#getuserdetails))
instead.

### getTradeHistory(\[options])

- `options` — Optional [`TradeHistoryOptions`](#tradehistoryoptions):
  - `maxTrades` — Max trades to return (default 100).
  - `startAfterTime` / `startAfterTradeId` — Cursor: the time and id of the last trade from the previous page. Pass both to fetch the next page.
  - `navigatingBack` — Page backwards (toward newer trades) instead of forward.
  - `includeFailed` — Include failed/rolled-back trades.
  - `includeTotal` — Ask Steam for the total trade count (populates `totalTrades`).

Returns past trades, newest first, as a `Promise<`[`TradeHistory`](#tradehistory)`>`. Each entry is a
fully-parsed [`ExchangeDetails`](#exchangedetails) plus its `tradeId` and `partnerSteamId`. To page,
take the last entry's `tradeInitTime`/`tradeId` and pass them as `startAfterTime`/`startAfterTradeId`
while `more` is `true`.

### getTradeOffersSummary()

Returns counts of pending/new/historical sent & received offers (and escrow counts) as a
`Promise<`[`TradeOffersSummary`](#tradeofferssummary)`>`. Cheap; useful as a "do I have anything to
look at?" check before a full `getOffers`.

### reconcile(ids)

- `ids` — An array of trade offer id strings.

Re-reads each id in parallel and returns a `Promise<Map<string, TradeOffer>>` keyed by id. **Missing or
errored ids are skipped**, so one bad id can't fail the whole batch. This is the authoritative,
poll-free way to track offers you've sent: persist the id from `send()`, then reconcile it on demand.

### getOffersContainingItems(items\[]\[, includeInactive])

- `items` — An array of `{ appid, contextid, assetid }` item references.
- `includeInactive` — Optional. If `true`, searches all offers; otherwise active only (default `false`).

Returns the offers that contain **all** of the given items, as a `Promise<TradeOffer[]>`.

### getInventory(target, appid\[, contextid]\[, options])

- `target` — An [`OfferTarget`](#offertarget) identifying whose inventory to load (typically a partner via `{ tradeUrl }`).
- `appid` — The app id (e.g. `730` for CS2, `252490` for Rust).
- `contextid` — Optional. The context id (default `"2"`).
- `options`
  - `tradableOnly` — Optional. If `true`, only tradable items are returned (default `false`).

Loads a **partner's** inventory through the trade-offer page (`/tradeoffer/new/partnerinventory/`),
which is the reliable way to see a partner's items — including trade-protected ones that the public
`/inventory/` endpoint hides. Returns `Promise<`[`EconItem`](#econitem)`[]>`, paginated automatically.
For your *own* inventory, prefer [`bot.community.getInventory`](#getinventoryappid-contextid-options).

On failure, the partner's trade page is lazily scraped for Steam's `<div id="error_msg">` and the
message is classified into the right typed [error](#errors) (`PrivateInventoryError`,
`TradeBanError`, `TargetCannotTradeError`, `ItemServerUnavailableError`, …).

### startPolling(\[options])

- `options` — Optional [`PollOptions`](#polloptions):
  - `pollInterval` — Active-poll cadence in ms (default `10000`).
  - `pollFullUpdateInterval` — Full-sweep cadence in ms (default `300000`).
  - `pollData` — A saved [`PollData`](#polldata) snapshot to resume from (so a restart doesn't re-emit known offers).
  - `store` — A [`PollDataStore`](#polldatastore) loaded on start and saved after each changed tick (e.g. Redis-backed). Default: in-memory only.
  - `maxAgeMs` — Retention window in ms (default `2592000000`, 30d). Terminal offers older than this are pruned from the snapshot, and the full sweep is bounded to this window.
  - `cancelTime` — If set, auto-cancels a sent offer still `Active` this many ms after its last update, emitting [`sentOfferCanceled`](#event-sentoffercanceled). Off by default.

Starts the poll loop. The library does an **active poll** (recently-changed offers only) on the short
interval and a periodic **full sweep** (offers updated within the retention window, to catch backdated
state changes) on the long interval. State changes are diffed against the last snapshot and surfaced as
[events](#trade-events). The loop never dies on a rate limit — it backs off and resumes. Calling this
again replaces the running loop.

### stopPolling()

Stops the poll loop.

### pollOnce(\[options])

- `options` — Optional. A [`PollOptions`](#polloptions) (used to configure the lazily-created poller on first call) plus `forceFull?` to force a full sweep this cycle.

Runs a **single, timer-less** poll cycle, for driving cadence from an external scheduler (e.g. a BullMQ
cron) instead of the built-in timer. Returns `Promise<{ changes:`[`PollChange`](#pollchange)`[]; pollData: PollData }>`.
With a [`store`](#polldatastore) it loads the snapshot, diffs, emits the usual [events](#trade-events),
saves, and returns the diff. `lastFullUpdate` is persisted inside `pollData`, so a fresh instance per
job still keeps the full-sweep cadence (it won't degrade to a full sweep every call). The poller is
created lazily and reused, so pass config once. Unlike the timer loop, this **throws** on a fetch
failure so your scheduler can handle it.

### pollData (getter)

A getter returning the current [`PollData`](#polldata) snapshot, or `undefined` if polling isn't
running. Usually you persist this via the [`pollData` event](#event-polldata) rather than reading it
directly.

### Trade events

`bot.trade` (and `bot`, which re-emits them) emits:

#### Event: newOffer

- `offer` — A [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) for the newly-received offer.

Emitted when someone sends you a new trade offer.

#### Event: receivedOfferChanged

- `offer` — The [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) in its new state.
- `oldState` — The previous [`ETradeOfferState`](#etradeofferstate).

Emitted when an offer you received changes state (e.g. you accepted it elsewhere, or it expired).

#### Event: sentOfferChanged

- `offer` — The [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) in its new state.
- `oldState` — The previous [`ETradeOfferState`](#etradeofferstate).

Emitted when an offer you sent changes state (e.g. the partner accepted or declined it).

#### Event: unknownOfferSent

- `offer` — The [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer).

Emitted when polling sees a sent offer it has no record of — either sent out-of-band (not via this
client) or seen on the first cold poll.

#### Event: sentOfferCanceled

- `offer` — The [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) that was canceled.
- `reason` — Why it was canceled; currently always `"cancelTime"`.

Emitted when the poll loop auto-cancels a sent offer because it stayed `Active` past
[`cancelTime`](#startpollingoptions). The resulting `Active → Canceled` transition also surfaces as a
normal [`sentOfferChanged`](#event-sentofferchanged) on a later poll.

#### Event: offerUpdate

- `update` — A [`TradeOfferUpdate`](#tradeofferupdate) `{ offer, previousState? }`.

Fires once for **every** offer change, alongside the specific named event above. `previousState` is
`undefined` the first time an offer is observed; `offer.isOurOffer` distinguishes sent vs received. Use
this when you want a single handler for all changes (e.g. forwarding to a queue); use the named events
when you want to react to one kind.

#### Event: pollData

- `data` — The new [`PollData`](#polldata) snapshot.

Emitted whenever the poll snapshot changes. **Persist this** and pass it back as `pollData` on the next
`startPolling` to resume without re-emitting offers you've already handled.

#### Event: pollSuccess

Emitted after each successful poll cycle.

#### Event: pollFailure

- `error` — The `Error` that caused the failed poll.

Emitted when a poll cycle fails. The loop keeps running; this is informational.

#### Event: debug

- `message` — A human-readable debug string.

Verbose internal logging (cursor pages, mint/renewal, backoff). Listen on this while developing.

## TradeOffer

Represents a single trade offer — either one you're building to send, or one fetched from Steam. Build
offers with [`bot.trade.createOffer`](#createoffertarget); fetch them with
[`bot.trade.getTradeOffer`](#gettradeofferid) / `getOffers` / `getTradeOffers`.

### Offer properties

- `id` — The offer id (`string`), or `undefined` before it's been sent.
- `partner` — A [`SteamID`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamid) for the other party.
- `token` — The partner's trade-URL token (`string`), if known.
- `message` — The offer message (≤128 chars).
- `state` — The current [`ETradeOfferState`](#etradeofferstate).
- `itemsToGive` — Array of [`TradeItem`](#tradeitem) (full [`EconItem`](#econitem)s on fetched offers) you'd give up.
- `itemsToReceive` — Array of items you'd receive.
- `isOurOffer` — `true` if we sent it, `false` if we received it.
- `tradeID` — The trade id once accepted (`string`), or `undefined`. Needed for [`getTradeStatus()`](#gettradestatus).
- `confirmationMethod` — An [`EConfirmationMethod`](#econfirmationmethod) (`MobileApp`, `Email`, or `None`).
- `escrowEnds` — A `Date` when the Steam Guard escrow hold ends, or `undefined`.
- `settlementDate` — A `Date` when the 2025 trade-protection hold ends and items become final, or `undefined`. Equals the trade's `time_settlement` (~7–8 days after accept); set only once `Accepted`. Separate from `escrowEnds`.
- `delaySettlement` — `true` when the trade's items are subject to the trade-protection settlement delay.
- `created` / `updated` / `expires` — `Date`s, or `undefined`.
- `fromRealTimeTrade` — `true` if this came from a real-time trade session.
- `glitched` — `true` when the offer is missing item names (descriptions not ready) or has no items. Polling won't advance its cutoff past a glitched offer, so it gets re-polled until complete.

### give(items)

- `items` — An array of [`TradeItem`](#tradeitem) (`{ appid, contextid, assetid, amount? }`).

Adds items **you** will give. Chainable (returns the offer). Array-only.

### receive(items)

- `items` — An array of [`TradeItem`](#tradeitem).

Adds items you'll receive from the partner. Chainable.

### setMessage(message)

- `message` — The offer message (truncated to 128 characters).

Sets the message. Chainable. Throws if the offer has already been sent.

### send()

Sends the offer. Before sending it best-effort acknowledges the 2025 trade-protection notice (which
Steam otherwise blocks new offers on). Returns a `Promise` resolving to a **`SendResult`**:

- `"sent"` — The offer is live; `offer.id` and `offer.state` (`Active`) are now set.
- `"needs_confirmation"` — The offer was created but needs a mobile/email confirmation. Call [`confirm()`](#confirm).

Throws a typed [error](#errors) on failure (e.g. `OfferLimitError`, `TradeBanError`,
`SteamSessionExpiredError`). Throws if the offer is empty or already sent.

### accept()

Accepts an offer **you received**. Returns a `Promise` resolving to an **`AcceptResult`**:

- `"accepted"` — Done; items have transferred.
- `"escrow"` — Accepted but held in escrow (`offer.escrowEnds` tells you until when).
- `"needs_confirmation"` — Needs a mobile/email confirmation; call [`confirm()`](#confirm).

Because the accept response doesn't itself flag escrow, this re-reads the offer afterward to tell a
held trade from a settled one (best-effort; falls back to `"accepted"`). Throws if the offer isn't
active, is our own, or on a Steam error.

### cancel()

Cancels an offer you sent (or, for a received offer, declines it) via the community endpoint — the Web
API rejects the mobile token for this. Returns `Promise<void>`. Throws if the offer isn't active /
pending-confirmation.

### decline()

Alias for [`cancel()`](#cancel); use it for readability on received offers.

### confirm()

Accepts the pending mobile confirmation for this offer (after `send()`/`accept()` returned
`"needs_confirmation"`). Returns `Promise<void>`. Throws a `ConfirmationError` immediately if the
offer is unsent, if `identitySecret` wasn't supplied to the `SteamMobile` constructor (named-fix
message: *"identitySecret is required to confirm trade offers — construct SteamMobile with
{ identitySecret }"*), or if no matching confirmation is found.

### counter()

Returns a **new** unsent [TradeOffer](#tradeoffer) to the same partner, pre-filled with this offer's
items and message (deep-copied, so editing the counter won't mutate the original). Edit it and call
`send()`; sending marks the original as countered. Throws if the original isn't active.

### getTradeStatus()

Shortcut for [`bot.trade.getTradeStatus({ tradeId: this.tradeID })`](#gettradestatustradeid). Returns
`Promise<`[`ExchangeDetails`](#exchangedetails)`>`. Throws if the offer has no `tradeID` (i.e. it hasn't
been accepted).

### getPartnerInventory(appid\[, contextid]\[, tradableOnly])

- `appid` — App id.
- `contextid` — Optional context id (default `"2"`).
- `tradableOnly` — Optional. Tradable items only.

Loads the **partner's** inventory, reusing this offer's partner and token. Returns
`Promise<`[`EconItem`](#econitem)`[]>`.

### getUserDetails()

Persona, contexts, escrow days, avatars, and partner probation for both sides — McKay-parity. Scrapes
the trade page once. Picks the URL based on the offer's state: `/tradeoffer/<id>/` for offers that
have already been sent, otherwise `/tradeoffer/new/?partner=…[&token=…]` for an unsent draft. Returns
`Promise<`[`UserDetails`](#userdetails)`>`. **Steam applies `max(me.escrowDays, them.escrowDays)`** as
the actual hold — compute that yourself if you need a single number.

Use this when you already have a `TradeOffer` in hand. If you only have a tradeUrl/SteamID, prefer
the top-level [`bot.trade.getUserDetails(target)`](#getuserdetailstarget) — same scrape, no offer
construction needed.

Throws when called on an offer where Steam doesn't render trade info:

- An offer **we sent** (`isOurOffer === true` with `this.id` set) — Steam shows our own offers from a
  different view. Use [`bot.trade.getUserDetails(target)`](#getuserdetailstarget) instead.
- An offer **received** but no longer `Active` (already accepted, declined, expired, etc.).

### containsItem(item)

- `item` — `{ appid, contextid, assetid }`.

Returns `true` if either side of the offer contains that exact asset.

---

## bot.community

Account- and profile-level helpers backed by `steamcommunity.com` and a couple of Web API calls.

### getInventory(appid\[, contextid]\[, options])

- `appid` — App id.
- `contextid` — Optional context id (default `"2"`).
- `options`
  - `steamId` — Optional. Whose inventory to load (default: yourself).
  - `tradableOnly` — Optional. If `true`, only tradable items are returned (default `false`). For your
    own inventory this is applied server-side via the legacy endpoint's `trading=1` flag; for other
    users it's applied in the parser.

Loads your own inventory — or any **public** inventory — paginated automatically. Returns
`Promise<`[`EconItem`](#econitem)`[]>`. Throws `PrivateInventoryError` on a private inventory (the
lazy trade-page scrape also classifies trade-ban / target-cannot-trade / item-server-unavailable
errors into their typed counterparts).

Routes by target:

- **Self** → the legacy `/profiles/<id>/inventory/json/<appid>/<contextid>` endpoint (cookie path,
  near-nonexistent rate limits, surfaces trade-protected items). The modern
  `IEconService/GetInventoryItemsWithDescriptions` is avoided here — Steam silently returns
  `{response:{}}` on ≥2 calls/sec, making it unfit for repeated use.
- **Other user** → the public `/inventory/` endpoint (cookie path).

For a trade **partner's** inventory, use
[`bot.trade.getInventory`](#getinventorytarget-appid-contextid-options) instead — `/partnerinventory/`
is the only path that reveals trade-protected items.

### getTradeURL()

Returns your current trade URL and token as `Promise<{ url: string; token: string }>`.

### changeTradeURL()

Regenerates (and thereby **invalidates**) your trade URL/token. Returns the new
`Promise<{ url: string; token: string }>`.

### getProfile(\[steamId])

- `steamId` — Optional. Whose profile to read (default: yourself).

Reads a profile summary from the community XML in a **single request**. Returns a
`Promise<`[`SteamProfile`](#steamprofile)`>` with persona, avatar, account-creation date, trade-ban
state, VAC status, privacy state, and the `isLimited` flag. (Steam level isn't in the XML — use
`getSteamLevel`.)

### getSteamLevel(\[steamId])

- `steamId` — Optional (default: yourself).

Returns the account's Steam level as a `Promise<number>` via `IPlayerService/GetSteamLevel` (which
accepts the access token — no API key required).

### community.ensureApiKey(\[domain])

- `domain` — Optional hostname for the key (default `"assetpay.gg"`).

Returns the existing Web API key, or registers a new one (auto-accepting the mobile confirmation if
`identitySecret` is set), as `Promise<string | null>`. Resolves to `null` when the account is
ineligible (unverified email, no authenticator, or limited). The registration flow handles Steam's
Pending → confirm → retry handshake for you.

### acknowledgeTradeProtection()

Acknowledges the 2025 trade-protection notice. Called automatically by [`send()`](#send); exposed here
for completeness. Returns `Promise<void>`.

---

## bot.session

The `SessionManager` owns the token lifecycle. You rarely call it directly — the namespaces refresh the
access token for you — but it's where session control lives.

### getAccessToken()

Returns a valid access token, minting or renewing it if needed, as `Promise<string>`. Concurrent calls
share one in-flight mint. Throws `SteamSessionExpiredError` if the session has been revoked or the
refresh token is dead.

### listSessions()

Returns the client ids of in-progress auth sessions (login-approval flows) as `Promise<bigint[]>`.
Note: this is **not** a list of logged-in devices — it reflects pending `IAuthenticationService`
sessions.

### logout(\[action])

- `action` — Optional [`EAuthTokenRevokeAction`](#eauthtokenrevokeaction) (default `Logout`).

Revokes this refresh token server-side. Afterward the session is dead and any further call throws
`SteamSessionExpiredError`. Returns `Promise<void>`.

### setRefreshToken(refreshToken)

- `refreshToken` — A fresh MobileApp refresh token for the **same** account.

Swaps in a new refresh token and re-mints in place — the mechanism behind
[`bot.reauthenticate`](#reauthenticatecredentials). Re-emits [`refreshToken`](#event-refreshtoken).
Throws if the token is malformed or belongs to a different account. Returns `Promise<void>`.

### Properties & events

- `refreshToken` / `accessToken` / `steamID` — Same values surfaced on [`SteamMobile`](#properties).
- Events: `refreshToken`, `sessionExpired`, `debug` — re-emitted on the root client.

---

## bot.confirmations

The `ConfirmationManager` for mobile confirmations. **Prefer [`offer.confirm()`](#confirm)** for trades;
these cover other cases (market listings, API-key requests, manual flows). All require `identitySecret`.

The high-level helpers below derive the TOTP time and HMAC key for you — you normally only need these.
The lower-level `getConfirmations`/`respondToConfirmation` remain for when you want to compute keys yourself.

### getPending()

Returns all outstanding confirmations as `Promise<`[`Confirmation`](#confirmation)`[]>`, deriving the
list HMAC automatically.

### acceptConfirmation(id, nonce) · rejectConfirmation(id, nonce)

Accept or reject (cancel) a single confirmation by its `id` and `nonce` (the `key` field from
[`getPending`](#getpending)). Each returns `Promise<void>` and handles the time-offset + per-request
HMAC timestamp for you.

### acceptAll()

Accepts every pending confirmation and resolves to the [`Confirmation`](#confirmation)`[]` it acted on.
Fails fast on the first error.

```ts
for (const c of await bot.confirmations.getPending()) console.log(c.title);
await bot.confirmations.acceptAll();
```

### getConfirmations(time, key)

- `time` — A Unix timestamp (use the manager's server-time-corrected clock).
- `key` — A confirmation key, or `{ tag, key }`.

Returns the outstanding confirmations as `Promise<`[`Confirmation`](#confirmation)`[]>`.

### respondToConfirmation(confID, confKey, time, key, accept)

- `confID` — The confirmation id.
- `confKey` — The confirmation's nonce.
- `time` — A Unix timestamp.
- `key` — A confirmation key, or `{ tag, key }`.
- `accept` — `true` to allow, `false` to cancel.

Accepts or rejects a single confirmation. Returns `Promise<void>`.

### acceptConfirmationForObject(objectID)

- `objectID` — The id of the object the confirmation is for (e.g. a trade offer id, or an API-key request id).

Finds and accepts the confirmation tied to that object, handling the time-offset and per-request HMAC
timestamps for you. Returns `Promise<void>`. Throws a `ConfirmationError` if no matching confirmation
exists.

---

## decodePreviewToken

A standalone helper (not on the bot) that decodes a **CS2 masked preview token** — the inspect-data
blob Steam ships in an item's `asset_properties` under `propertyid: 6` (the "certificate") — into a
plain JSON object. The same masked format is used by `csgo_econ_action_preview` market inspect tokens.
Decoding is fully offline (XOR-unmask → protobuf), so no game-coordinator call is needed.

```ts
import { decodePreviewToken } from "steam-mobile";

const cert = item.asset_properties.find((p) => p.propertyid === 6)?.string_value;
const data = decodePreviewToken(cert);
// {
//   itemid: "51663785755", defindex: 4, paintindex: 230, rarity: 4, quality: 9,
//   paintwear: 0.18685653805732727, paintseed: 34,
//   stickers: [{ slot: 2, stickerId: 6618 }, …],
//   inventory: 3221225475, origin: 8,
//   keychains: [{ slot: 0, stickerId: 54, offsetX: -1.55…, pattern: 34792 }],
// }
```

- `hex` — The raw certificate hex (or any `[xorKey][protobuf][crc32]` masked blob). Pass it as-is; no
  trimming or tag-stripping needed.
- Returns the decoded [`CEconItemPreviewDataBlock`](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs/blob/master/csgo/cstrike15_gcmessages.proto#L917)
  as a plain object (`Record<string, unknown>`), or `null` for non-hex / undecodable input.

Output notes: `itemid` (uint64) is a **string**, fields are **camelCase** (`sticker_id` → `stickerId`,
`offset_x` → `offsetX`), only fields actually present on the wire are included, and `paintwear` is
returned as the **float wear** (`0..1`) rather than its raw uint32 bits.

> S/A/D inspect links (the ones with a `D…` parameter) are **not** decodable this way — those carry no
> embedded data and require a live game-coordinator lookup.

---

## Data types

### OfferTarget

Identifies a trade partner. It's a discriminated union — supply **one** of the two shapes:

```ts
type OfferTarget =
  | { tradeUrl: string }            // a full trade URL (partner + token parsed out)
  | { steamId: string; token?: string };  // a SteamID64, optionally with a trade token
```

### TradeItem

The minimal shape needed to put an item into an offer:

```ts
interface TradeItem {
  appid: number;
  contextid: string;
  assetid: string;
  amount?: number; // default 1
}
```

### EconItem

The fully-typed item, with Steam's fields preserved 1:1 (snake_case, lossless). Returned by every
inventory and offer read. Key fields:

- `appid` (number), `contextid`, `assetid`, `classid`, `instanceid`, `amount`, `currencyid?`
- `name`, `market_name`, `market_hash_name`, `type`, `name_color?`, `background_color?`
- `icon_url`, `icon_url_large?`
- `tradable`, `marketable`, `commodity` (booleans), `market_tradable_restriction`, `market_marketable_restriction` (numbers)
- `descriptions`, `owner_descriptions` ([`SteamDescriptionLine`](#data-types)[]), `actions`, `market_actions` (`SteamAction[]`), `fraudwarnings` (string[]), `tags` (`SteamTag[]`)
- `asset_properties` ([`AssetProperty`](#data-types)[]) — CS2 float/seed/sticker data when present; decode the `propertyid: 6` certificate with [`decodePreviewToken`](#decodepreviewtoken)
- Any other field Steam returns is preserved (`[key: string]: unknown`).

### ExchangeItem

An [`EconItem`](#econitem) plus where it landed after the trade settled:

```ts
interface ExchangeItem extends EconItem {
  new_assetid?: string;        // Rust populates these; CS2 usually omits them
  new_contextid?: string;
  rollback_new_assetid?: string;
  rollback_new_contextid?: string;
}
```

### ExchangeDetails

Returned by [`getTradeStatus`](#gettradestatustradeid):

```ts
interface ExchangeDetails {
  status: ETradeStatus;
  tradeInitTime: Date;
  settlementTime: Date | null;   // when items were actually delivered
  receivedItems: ExchangeItem[];
  sentItems: ExchangeItem[];
  usedInventoryFallback: boolean; // always false — surfacing new_assetid is enough; reconciling by inventory diff is the server's job
}
```

### TradeHistory

Returned by [`getTradeHistory`](#gettradehistoryoptions):

```ts
interface TradeHistory {
  trades: TradeHistoryEntry[];   // newest first
  more: boolean;                 // are there more pages?
  totalTrades: number | undefined; // only when includeTotal was set
}

interface TradeHistoryEntry extends ExchangeDetails {
  tradeId: string;
  partnerSteamId: string | undefined;
}
```

### TradeHistoryOptions

See [`getTradeHistory`](#gettradehistoryoptions) for field meanings: `maxTrades?`, `startAfterTime?`,
`startAfterTradeId?`, `navigatingBack?`, `includeFailed?`, `includeTotal?`.

### TradeOffersSummary

Returned by [`getTradeOffersSummary`](#gettradeofferssummary) — all `number`:

`pending_received_count`, `new_received_count`, `updated_received_count`, `historical_received_count`,
`pending_sent_count`, `newly_accepted_sent_count`, `updated_sent_count`, `historical_sent_count`,
`escrow_received_count`, `escrow_sent_count`.

### SteamProfile

Returned by [`getProfile`](#getprofilesteamid):

```ts
interface SteamProfile {
  steamId: string;
  personaName: string;
  avatar: string;
  accountCreated: Date | null;
  tradeBanState: string;   // e.g. "None"
  isLimited: boolean;
  vacBanned: boolean;
  privacyState: string;    // e.g. "public"
}
```

### UserDetails

Returned by [`bot.trade.getUserDetails(target)`](#getuserdetailstarget) and
[`offer.getUserDetails()`](#getuserdetails) — mirrors steamcommunity's `TradeOffer#getUserDetails`:

```ts
interface UserDetails {
  me: UserSideDetails;
  them: UserPartnerDetails;
}

interface UserSideDetails {
  personaName: string;
  contexts: Record<string, unknown> | null;
  escrowDays: number;             // your side; Steam holds for max(me, them) days
  avatarIcon: string | undefined; // .jpg
  avatarMedium: string | undefined; // _medium.jpg
  avatarFull: string | undefined;   // _full.jpg
}

interface UserPartnerDetails extends UserSideDetails {
  probation: boolean; // partner is on Steam-trade probation (see Steam's warning banner)
}
```

### EscrowHold

Returned by [`bot.trade.getEscrow`](#getescrowtarget) — escrow-only, in **seconds**. Top-level keys
renamed from Steam's `my_escrow`/`their_escrow`/`both_escrow`; inner shape preserved 1:1:

```ts
interface EscrowHold {
  me: EscrowSide;
  them: EscrowSide;
  both: EscrowSide;
}

interface EscrowSide {
  escrow_end_duration_seconds: number;
}
```

### PollData

The poll snapshot — persist it via the [`pollData` event](#event-polldata) and pass it back to
[`startPolling`](#startpollingoptions):

```ts
interface PollData {
  offersSince: number;                          // Unix seconds of the newest processed update
  sent: Record<string, ETradeOfferState>;       // offer id -> last seen state
  received: Record<string, ETradeOfferState>;
  timestamps: Record<string, number>;
  lastFullUpdate?: number;                       // ms epoch of the last full sweep; persisted so the cadence survives stateless workers
}
```

### PollOptions

See [`startPolling`](#startpollingoptions): `pollInterval?` (default 10000 ms), `pollFullUpdateInterval?`
(default 300000 ms), `pollData?`, `store?` (a [`PollDataStore`](#polldatastore)), `maxAgeMs?` (default
30d), `cancelTime?` (off by default).

### PollDataStore

Pluggable persistence for the poll snapshot — implement it to keep `pollData` in Redis (or anywhere) so
any worker can resume a bot's poll. You own one-tick-at-a-time mutual exclusion; the library owns the
diff. Use it with [`startPolling`](#startpollingoptions) (timer) or [`pollOnce`](#pollonceoptions) (cron).

```ts
interface PollDataStore {
  load(): Promise<PollData | undefined>;
  save(pollData: PollData): Promise<void>;
}
```

### PollChange

One offer transition returned by [`pollOnce`](#pollonceoptions) (the same set is also emitted as
[trade events](#trade-events)):

```ts
type PollChange =
  | { type: "newOffer"; offer: TradeOffer }
  | { type: "sentOfferChanged"; offer: TradeOffer; oldState: ETradeOfferState }
  | { type: "receivedOfferChanged"; offer: TradeOffer; oldState: ETradeOfferState }
  | { type: "unknownOfferSent"; offer: TradeOffer };
```

### TradeOfferUpdate

The payload of the [`offerUpdate`](#event-offerupdate) event — a unified view of any single offer
change. `previousState` is `undefined` the first time an offer is seen; direction is `offer.isOurOffer`:

```ts
interface TradeOfferUpdate {
  offer: TradeOffer;
  previousState?: ETradeOfferState;
}
```

### Confirmation

Returned by [`getConfirmations`](#getconfirmationstime-key): `id`, `type`, `creator`, `key` (nonce),
`title`, `receiving`, `sending`, `time` (ISO string), `timestamp` (`Date`), `icon`.

---

### Others

`EAuthTokenPlatformType`, `ESessionPersistence`, `ETokenRenewalType`, and the full `EResult` table are
also exported.

---

## Errors

Every error extends **`SteamError`**, which carries an optional `eresult` (a Steam `EResult`) and `body`
(the raw response). The library **classifies** errors but does not implement a cooldown policy — retry
logic stays in your code.

Steam-supplied messages (the `strError` field on send/accept/cancel responses **and** the
`<div id="error_msg">` text scraped from the trade page when an inventory load fails) are run through
one shared classifier so the same `instanceof` check works everywhere.

| Class | Extra fields | Meaning |
| ----- | ------------ | ------- |
| `SteamError` | `eresult?`, `body?` | Base class for everything. |
| `HttpStatusError` | `statusCode` | A non-2xx HTTP response. |
| `SteamSessionExpiredError` | — | The session/token is no longer valid; re-authenticate. |
| `RateLimitError` | `statusCode?`, `retryAfterMs`, `unlockAt` | Rate limited (HTTP 429 or eresult 84). `unlockAt` is a millisecond epoch when you may retry — **always populated** (a conservative default when Steam gives no hint). |
| `ProxyError` | `cause?` | A request through a configured proxy failed at the transport layer (unreachable / refused / timeout / auth). Only thrown when a `proxy` is set. |
| `EscrowError` | `escrowDays` | The trade would be (or is) held in escrow. |
| `TradeBanError` | — | The account is trade-banned. |
| `OfferLimitError` | `eresult = 25` | Sent too many offers. |
| `TargetCannotTradeError` | `eresult?` | Partner is not available to trade (limited, escrow-only, etc.). |
| `NewDeviceError` | `eresult?` | Steam blocks the action because we logged in from a new device recently. |
| `ItemServerUnavailableError` | `eresult = 102` | The game's item server (its Game Coordinator) is unreachable — transient, per-app, retry shortly. |
| `PrivateInventoryError` | — | Partner's inventory is private (or friends-only and we're not friends). A trade URL/token does **not** bypass inventory privacy. |
| `ConfirmationError` | — | A mobile-confirmation step failed (incl. missing `identitySecret` when calling [`offer.confirm()`](#confirm)). |
| `FamilyViewError` | — | Family View is restricting the account. |
| `LoginError` | `extendedErrorMessage?`, `isTransient` | Credential-login failure; `isTransient` is `true` for a retryable blip (timeout / service unavailable) rather than bad credentials. |
| `NoMobileAuthenticatorError` | (extends `LoginError`) | `sharedSecret` was supplied but the account has no mobile authenticator attached, so TOTP can't answer the guard challenge. Use `steamGuardCode` / `onSteamGuardRequired` with an email code instead. |

`unlockAt` / `retryAfterMs` on `RateLimitError` are never `undefined`, so a cooldown is just
`cooldownUntil = err.unlockAt`:

```ts
import { RateLimitError } from "steam-mobile";

try {
  await bot.trade.getTradeOffers();
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof RateLimitError) {
    await sleepUntil(err.unlockAt);
  } else throw err;
}
```

---

## Mobile-app impersonation

The client presents as the Steam mobile app on the wire: per-host user agents, the `mobileClient`
cookie, an `origin=SteamMobile` header on writes, and `mobileconf` confirmations. Pick a preset with
`mobileProfile: "ios"` (default) or `"android"`, or override individual fields with an object.

A **`MobileProfile`** has: `mobileClient` (`"ios"` | `"android"`), `mobileClientVersion`,
`apiUserAgent`, `webUserAgent`, `deviceFriendlyName` (iOS sends the model id, e.g. `"iPhone18,3"`),
`osType` (signed EOSType; iOS `-600`, Android `-500`), `gamingDeviceType`, and `appType?`. The
`IOS_PROFILE` and `ANDROID_PROFILE` constants (captured from real apps) and `resolveMobileProfile` are
exported if you want to build on them.

```ts
const bot = new SteamMobile({
  refreshToken,
  mobileProfile: { mobileClient: "ios", deviceFriendlyName: "iPhone17,2" },
});
```

---

## Notes & limitations

- **MobileApp-only.** No real-time CM push — offer detection is polling. No Game Coordinator (item data
  comes from the web `asset_properties`). No chat/presence.
- **Limited accounts** (haven't spent the $5 that lifts Steam's anti-spam limit) **can still trade** —
  subject to the usual Steam Guard / escrow holds — but can't use the Community Market or generate a
  Web API key. This library doesn't use a Web API key (it authenticates with the mobile access token),
  so limited accounts can send and receive trades through it. `getProfile().isLimited` surfaces the
  state; `ensureApiKey()` returns `null`.
- **English only** (`l=english`) by design — no localization dependency.
- **Settlement is read-only.** `getTradeStatus` surfaces Steam's `new_assetid`/`new_contextid`;
  reconciling items by inventory diff (the race-prone part) is left to your server, which has the
  concurrency context. `usedInventoryFallback` is therefore always `false`.
- **No auto-retry.** Rate limits are thrown as `RateLimitError` — always with a concrete `unlockAt`, so
  the caller's cooldown needs no guesswork (the poll loop is the one exception: it backs off and resumes).

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (strict NodeNext)
pnpm lint        # biome
pnpm test        # vitest
pnpm build       # tsdown → dist (ESM + d.ts)
pnpm proto       # regenerate src/protobufs from protobufs/*.proto (buf + protoc-gen-es)
```

Live debug scripts live in `debug/` and read a `.env` for credentials:

```bash
pnpm bootstrap          # credential login → save ./bot.refreshtoken (run once)
pnpm smoke              # read-only health check across the whole API
pnpm watch              # live trade-event watcher — send the bot a trade and watch it fire
pnpm trade              # send → confirm → cancel lifecycle (gated: SEND=1 PARTNER_TRADE_URL=…; needs a non-limited bot)
pnpm partner-inventory  # load a partner's inventory via /partnerinventory/ (PARTNER_TRADE_URL=…; surfaces PrivateInventoryError etc.)
```
